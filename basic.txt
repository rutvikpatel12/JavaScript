1) What is JavaScript ?
 -> JavaScript is an interpreted, client-side, event-based, object-oriented scripting language.
 -> JavaScript Developed for 1995 at Netscape Corporation (LiveScript).
 -> JavaScript Programs are run by an interpreter built into the user's web browser
 -> It is a case-sensitive language
 -> JavaScript is not Java

2) What can do JavaScript
    1. JavaScript can dynamically modify an HTML page
    2. JavaScript can validate user input JavaScript can validate user input
    3. JavaScript can validate user input
    4. JavaScript can be used to crate cookies
    5. JavaScript is a full-featured programming language
    6. JavaScript user interaction does not require any communication with the server

3) JavaScript Framework and Libraries
    1. Angular
    2. React
    3. Vue.js
    4. Node.js

4) Types of JavaScript
    1. Internel JavaScript
        A. JavaScript can be inserted into documents by using the SCRIPT tag.
        B. The SCRIPT tag provides a block to write the JavaScript programs.
        Examples:- 
            <script type="text/javascript">
                // JS code goes here
            </script>

    2. External JavaScript
        A. To use the pre-defined programs of any JavaScript Libraries
        Examples:-
            <script src="myscript.js"></script>

5) Important Function of JavaScript
    1. alert()
        It is used to alert the user that something has happened.
        Examples :- 
            <script type="text/javascript">
                alert("Hello Students..."); 
            </script>

    2. confirm()
        Opens up a Confirm/Cancel dialog and returns true/false depending on user's click.
        Examples :- 
            <script type="text/javascript">
                confirm("Login to WebSite.."); 
            </script>

    3. console.log()
        Writes information to the browser console, good for debugging purpose
        Examples :-
            <script type="text/javascript">
                console.log("JavaScript Tutorials..");
            </script>

    4. document.write()
        Write directly to the HTML document
        Examples :-
            <script type="text/javascript">
                document.write("Simple Page..");
            </script>

    5. prompt(msg.default)
        Creates an dialogue for user input
        Examples :-
            <script type="text/javascript">
                prompt("Hello","Students");
            </script>

6) What is variable?
 -> Variable are containers which hold reusable data.
 -> It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
 -> The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.

7) Scope and Life time of a variable
    1. Scope of a Variable :-
        -> variables declared within a function are local to that function.
        -> Variables declared outside of any function are global variable.

    2. Life Time of Variable :-
        -> Local variable's life time is within the block of its declaration.
        -> Global variable's life time is throughout the program.

8) Javascript DOM Function
    1. document.getElementById()
    2. document.getElementByClassName()
    3. innerHTML()

9) What is an Operator And Types of Operators in JS
    1) What is an Operator?
        -> An operator is a symbol that tell the compiler which arithmetic or logical operation to be performed between the respective operands.
    
    2) Types of Operators
        1. Arithmetic Operator
            a. (+) Addition         ->   Adds Two Numbers
            b. (-) Subtraction      ->   Subtracts the second operand from the first
            c. (*) Multiplication   ->   Multiply both operands
            d. (/) Division         ->   Divide the numerator by the denominator
            e. (%) Modules          ->   Output the remainder of an integer division
            f. (++) Increment       ->   Increases an integer value by one
            g. (--) Decrement       ->   Decreases an integer value by one
            
        2. Logical Operator
            a. (&&) Logical And
            b. (||) Logical OR

        3. Ternary Operator
            <condition> ? <true> : <false> -> Ex:- 2>1 ? "Yes" : "No"
                                    -> if 2 is greater than 1, yes will be printed else no will be printed
                                    
        4. Assignment Operator
            a. (=) Simple Assignment
            b. (+=) Add and Assignment
            c. (-=) Subtract and Assignment
            d. (*=) Multiply and Assignment
            e. (/=) Division and Assignment
            f. (%=) Modules and Assignment

        5. Comparison Operator
            a. (==) Equal
            b. (!=) Not Equal
            c. (>) Greater than
            d. (<) Less than
            e. (>=) Greater than or Equal to
            f. (<=) Less than or Equal to

10) Function in JavaScript
 -> Function are group of code or program which is used more often.
 -> It leads programming to code reusability and clean code.

 => Types of Function
    1. pre defined  ->  Such function are defined at the time of making of any language.
    2. user defined -> Such function defined by users according to their needs.

    -> Name: Just like a variable where we call "var" and give that a name, to create a function, we call "function" and give it a name in the same way

    Syntax :- function <functionName>(){
        // Function Body
    }

    -> Arguments: These are the inputs that the function will manipulate-separate multiple inputs with commas.

    Syntax :- function <functionName>(a,b){
        // Function Body
    }
